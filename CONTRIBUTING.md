## Firestore Database Guidelines

### Database Setup
1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Copy the configuration from your Firebase project settings
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase credentials
4. Enable Firestore Database in your Firebase project

### Database Modifications
When making changes to the database structure:
1. Document all schema changes in `/docs/database-schema.md`
2. Update security rules in [`firestore.rules`](./firestore.rules)
3. Provide migration scripts if changing existing collections
4. Test queries locally before submitting PR

### Security Considerations
- Never commit Firebase credentials
- Always use security rules to restrict data access
- Test rules using Firebase Emulator Suite
- Document any new indexes required for queries

### Local Development
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Start Firebase Emulator
firebase emulator:start
```
